Postmortem: Website Availability and Performance Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: The incident occurred on August 10, 2024, starting at 8:00 AM EDT and lasted for approximately 6 hours until 2:00 PM EDT.
Impact: The website for XYZ Company experienced complete unavailability and severe performance degradation. Users were unable to access the website, leading to a significant loss of online traffic and a 40% increase in customer complaints.
Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was identified as a combination of server overload due to unexpected high traffic and inefficient database queries.

Timeline:

8:00 AM EDT: Issue detected when users began reporting inability to access the website.
8:05 AM EDT: Started investigation independently, reviewing server logs and frontend performance metrics.
8:30 AM EDT: Initial assumption focused on frontend issues and server capacity constraints.
9:00 AM EDT: Explored misleading paths related to CDN configurations and server caching mechanisms.
10:00 AM EDT: Escalated investigation, identifying backend database queries as potential bottlenecks.
11:30 AM EDT: Confirmed inefficient database queries were impacting server response times.
12:00 PM EDT: Implemented database query optimizations and server-side caching strategies to alleviate load.
2:00 PM EDT: Website availability restored with improved performance metrics.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation: The website experienced unexpected high traffic coupled with inefficient database queries, causing server overload and unavailability.
Resolution Details: Optimized critical database queries by adding indexes and caching frequently accessed data. Implemented server-side caching to improve response times and handle increased traffic efficiently.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes: Enhance scalability and resilience of website infrastructure to handle sudden spikes in traffic.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
 1. Database Optimization: Conduct regular audits of database queries and optimize for efficiency.
 2. Server Capacity Planning: Review and upgrade server capacity to handle anticipated traffic growth.
 3. Monitoring and Alerting: Implement robust monitoring tools to detect performance issues early and provide real-time alerts.
 4. Load Testing: Perform regular load testing to simulate peak traffic scenarios and validate system performance.
